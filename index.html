      <p>My name is David Evans, and I'm one of over 25 million people from around the globe who are learning to code interactively, for free, with Codecademy.</p>
      <p>In 2015, I've gone from knowing nothing about code, to building professional websites and applications as used by real businesses, after learning with Codecademy.</p>
      <p>I've built a recent version of Airbnb's home page and learnt the fundamentals of web development in the process, and I've built the Flipboard home page and learnt how to add interactivity to your website.</p>
      <p>I got started coding in seconds with three 30 minute goals, and created <a href="animate_your_name">an animation of my name</a>, made a website all about me, and built my own galaxy.</p>
      <p>In the last two months, using over 15 hours of online content, I've learnt the core programming concepts and syntax for HTML & CSS - the world's most popular languages for structuring and styling web pages.</p>
